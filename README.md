# Weather-Search
This weather search site allows the user to input any city name in the US, and will pull up durrent weather information as well as forecasted info for the following 5 days. Information for current weather conditions include city name, date, an icon of conditions, temp, windspeed, humidity, and UV index.
For forecasted days, it does not include a UV index. 

Functions that still need to be added for desired function: Saving of search history for easy display of previously searched cities and their weather-casts, and also a color indicator for the UV index which indicates favorable,moderate,or severe.
